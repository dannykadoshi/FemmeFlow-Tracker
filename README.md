   - As the `creds.json` file contains sensitive information, it must never be committed or pushed to GitHub to ensure security.
   - Notice the `.gitignore` file in your workspace, which contains a list of files and directories that should not be committed or pushed to GitHub.
   - To safeguard your credentials, add `creds.json` to the `.gitignore` file. This prevents it from being accidentally uploaded to your version control repository.
   - Save the `.gitignore` file after adding `creds.json` by pressing CTRL-S (or equivalent for your system).

9. **Install Required Python Libraries:**
   - In your Python environment, install the required libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip3 install google-auth
     ```

10. **Use Python Code to Access Google Sheets:**

Use the following Python code to access your Google Sheets spreadsheet. 

```python
# Module for working with Google Sheets and authentication
import gspread
from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials

# Set up Google Sheets credentials and scope
SCOPE = [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"
]

# Load credentials from the service account file and create scoped credentials
CREDS = Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/your/downloaded/credentials.json')
SCOPED_CREDS = CREDS.with_scopes(SCOPE)

# Authorize the gspread client using the scoped credentials
GSPREAD_CLIENT = gspread.authorize(SCOPED_CREDS)

# Open the Google Sheets document named 'FemmeFlow Tracker (Responses)'
SHEET = GSPREAD_CLIENT.open('sheet name')

# Access the 'responses' worksheet within the Google Sheets document
responses = SHEET.worksheet('sheet name')
```

This code initializes the necessary credentials, authorizes the `gspread` client, and opens the 'FemmeFlow Tracker (Responses)' Google Sheets document, giving access to the 'responses' worksheet. 

By following these steps, you'll be able to connect your Google Sheets spreadsheet with Python using the Google Cloud Platform UI and retrieve data from your spreadsheet using the Google Sheets API.

### ‚û• GOOGLE SHEET SETUP TO SEND AUTOMATED EMAIL
---
To send automated emails based on the calculated data in the Google Sheets, I used the following Google Apps Script function. This function retrieves the necessary information from the spreadsheet and sends a personalized email to the last entry in the calculated_data sheet.

```javascript
function sendAutomatedEmailToLastEntry() {
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var calculatedDataSheet = ss.getSheetByName('calculated_data');
  var emailColumn = calculatedDataSheet.getRange("C:C").getValues();
  
  // Loop through the emailColumn array in reverse to find the last non-empty row
  var lastRow = emailColumn.length;
  for (var i = lastRow - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (emailColumn[i][0] !== "") {
      lastRow = i + 1; // Add 1 to convert from 0-based index to 1-based row number
      break;
    }
  }
  
  // Get the values from the last row
  var email = calculatedDataSheet.getRange(lastRow, 3).getValue(); // Email is in column C
  var name = calculatedDataSheet.getRange(lastRow, 2).getValue(); // Name is in column B
  var nextPeriodDate = calculatedDataSheet.getRange(lastRow, 7).getValue(); // Next Period Date in column G
  var fertileStartDate = calculatedDataSheet.getRange(lastRow, 8).getValue(); // Fertile Start Date in column H
  var fertileEndDate = calculatedDataSheet.getRange(lastRow, 9).getValue(); // Fertile End Date in column I

  var subject = 'Thank You for Using FemmeFlow Tracker!';
  var message = `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <!-- ... (Rest of the HTML content) ... -->
    </html>
  `;

  MailApp.sendEmail({
    to: email,
    subject: subject,
    htmlBody: message,
  });
}

// To set up this function, I followed these steps:
// 1. Open Google Sheets document.
